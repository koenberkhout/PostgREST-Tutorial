# Installation
There are several options and combinations in which you can use PostgREST. The first option is to locally set up and run the PostgreSQL database and the PostgREST server manually. The second option is to make use our provided configuration file for Docker. In this tutorial we'll demonstrate the second option, so feel free to read **A. Manual installation** in your own time and let's proceed to [B. Docker installation](https://sebivenlo.github.io/PostgREST-Workshop/installation-docker.html).
